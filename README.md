## ðŸ”„ Running Tests in CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

This project includes a **GitHub Actions** workflow that runs Cypress tests automatically on every **push** or **pull request** to the `main` branch.

### **GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/cypress-ci.yml`)**

- Runs Cypress tests in a **headless environment**.
- Generates an **HTML test report**.
- Uploads test reports as GitHub artifacts.

To trigger the workflow, simply push your changes:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Run Cypress tests in CI/CD"
git push origin main
```

You can view the results in the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository.

## ðŸ“Š Viewing Test Reports

Once the tests are complete, **Mochawesome reports** are available inside `mochawesome-report/`.

To open the HTML report locally:

```sh
open mochawesome-report/mochawesome_<timestamp>.html
```

Or manually open it in a browser.

In GitHub Actions, reports can be downloaded from **Artifacts** after the test run.
